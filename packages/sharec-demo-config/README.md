## Manual

You should complete a few steps for configuration package creation:

**1. Create empty npm package and initialize `npm` in the last one:**

```shell
mkdir my-awesome-configs
cd my-awesome-configs
npm init -y
```

**2. Install `sharec` as dependency:**

```shell
npm add sharec
```

Install `sharec` as **dependency**, not as devDependecy, it is very important!

**3. Add `sharec` commands to npm scripts in initialized package, `scripts` section in your
`package.json` should looks like:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "sharec install"
  }
}
```

**4. Create `configs` directory and store your files in:**

```shell
mkdir configs
```

Your configuration package should looks like:

```
â””â”€â”€ my-awesome-configs/
    â”œâ”€â”€ configs/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .babelrc
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .editorconfig
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

`my-awesome-configs/configs/package.json` â€“ should includes `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
which using by your configuration. For example, if you using `eslint` â€“ it should contain `eslint`
as dependency. It would be injected in `package.json` of target project.

**5. Publish it and install.**

You have created your own configuration and ready to use it. Publish it or keep on github and then
install in target project.

Have a nice day and use sharec! ðŸ˜‰
